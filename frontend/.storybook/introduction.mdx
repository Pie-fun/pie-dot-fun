## What is Storybook?

Storybook allows you to build components and pages in isolation, which means you can develop components without running your entire app. It helps you to create UIs more efficiently by providing a sandbox environment where you can focus on individual components.

- **Build components in isolation**: Write stories to test and showcase components without running your entire app.
- **Visual testing**: You can visually test the components as you develop them.
- **Documentation**: Storybook automatically generates documentation based on the stories you write.
